/**
 * Cancellation is only real if the caller's abort actually reaches the runtime.
 *
 * Every other cancellation test injects an `AbortSignal` straight into the
 * pipeline or attempt dependencies. Those prove the runtime *checks* a signal —
 * they cannot prove one is ever raised, because the test supplies the aborted
 * signal itself. The link they skip is the one that failed in practice: a caller
 * gives up, and whether that becomes an aborted `extra.signal` depends on the
 * client emitting `notifications/cancelled` and the SDK wiring it through.
 *
 * So drive a real SDK client over an in-memory transport and abort a live call.
