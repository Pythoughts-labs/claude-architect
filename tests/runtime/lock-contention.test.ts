/**
 * A repository lock that times out used to report only "checkout is locked:
 * <path>". Three very different situations produced that identical line: a
 * live sibling session mid-attempt, a lock file leaked by a process that died,
 * and a lock whose record recovery will never clean up. The first resolves
 * itself, the second clears on the next start, and the third needs a human.
 * These tests pin the message down to the distinction.
